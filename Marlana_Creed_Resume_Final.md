## TECHNICAL PROJECTS

### Independent Developer | 2023 - Present
*Built and deployed 10 web applications for education and accessibility*

---

### **Custom Learning Management System** | Python, Flask, SQL, HTML/CSS | PythonAnywhere

**Problem**
Google Forms limited verb conjugation assessments to multiple choice. Manual grading of 50+ student submissions with 6-8 fields each took 10+ hours weekly. No centralized progress tracking or gradebook existed for 14-week curriculum.

**Solution**
Full-stack quiz platform with Python/Flask backend and SQLite database. Student interface features multi-field text input for verb conjugations with instant auto-grading. Teacher dashboard provides real-time score tracking, progress monitoring, and grade management. Auto-grading algorithm with fuzzy matching validates conjugations across tenses.

**Technical Implementation:**
• User authentication and session management with Flask
• Relational database design for students, quizzes, and results
• RESTful API for quiz submission and score retrieval
• Dual user experiences optimized for student assessment and teacher analytics

**Impact**
- Reduced grading time from 10+ hours to 0 hours per week
- Deployed across 14-week curriculum serving 50+ ESOL students
- Improved student engagement with instant feedback
- Enabled data-driven instruction with progress analytics

### **School Job Board System** | Firebase, JavaScript, HTML/CSS

**Problem**
Advisors shared jobs and resources across multiple Google Classrooms, creating duplicate work. Students struggled to find current items or sort by deadlines. No centralized system existed for 100+ users across the school.

**Solution**
Firebase app with search, category, and date filters. Advisor role management allows posting in one location. Calendar view and deadline sorting help students prioritize. PDF and image uploads supported. Expired posts hidden by default with option to show archive.

**Impact**
- Advisors post in one place instead of 5+ Google Classrooms
- Students scan by category and deadline in seconds
- Admins manage expired items and export lists for newsletters
- Serving 100+ users at East Boston Harborside Community School

### **Job Application Tracker** | React, Firebase | GitHub Pages

**Problem**
Managing 100+ job applications across multiple sources became overwhelming. Needed motivation during long job search. No existing tools combined tracking with accountability features.

**Solution**
Full-stack tracker with Firebase Firestore backend for data persistence and real-time updates. Built-in gamification features (focus timer, reward system) to maintain motivation. CSV bulk import/export for data portability. Filtering by status, priority, and custom tags. Visual progress indicators and application timeline.

**Impact**
- Personally managed 100+ applications with measurable improvement in organization
- Reduced application follow-up time by 50% with automated reminders
- Gamification features helped maintain motivation through extended job search
- Open-sourced for other job seekers to use

### **ESOL Educational Games Suite** (5 applications) | JavaScript, HTML/CSS

**Problem**
Adult English learners needed interactive practice for grammar concepts. Textbook exercises lacked immediate feedback. Students struggled with motivation for repetitive conjugation drills.

**Solution**
Suite of 5 interactive games: Sentence Builder, Verb Conjugation, Number Recognition, Gerund/Infinitive practice, and vocabulary builders. Drag-and-drop mechanics, progressive difficulty levels, instant feedback, and mobile-responsive design. No login required for easy classroom deployment.

**Impact**
- Used weekly by 50+ adult English learners across multiple classes
- Improved student engagement with gamified practice
- Reduced prep time for instructors with ready-to-use activities
- Students can practice independently at home

### **ADHD Accessibility Tools** (3 applications) | React, Firebase

**Problem**
Neurodivergent individuals struggle with traditional productivity tools designed for neurotypical users. Executive function challenges require specialized interfaces. Limited accessible, sensory-friendly tools available.

**Solution**
Three-app suite: ADHD First Aid Kit (focus timers, task organizers, sensory-friendly UI), NAV Coaching Platform (coaching resources, community, booking system), and ADHD Dashboard (habit tracking with Firebase backend). User-tested with neurodivergent individuals. Implements WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards and reduced-stimulation design patterns.

**Impact**
- User-tested with neurodivergent community for real-world validation
- Positive feedback on sensory-friendly interface design
- NAV Coaching Platform actively used for client engagement
- Open-sourced ADHD First Aid Kit for community benefit
