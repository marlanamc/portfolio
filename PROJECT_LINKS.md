## ðŸŽ¯ How to Talk About These in Interviews

**For Data/Analytics Roles:**
"While teaching, I identified gaps in student learning and built data-driven tools to address them. For example, I created a sentence builder that tracks student progress patterns, helping me identify which grammar structures need more focus."

**For Product/Tech Roles:**
"I've shipped 6 production applications using React and Firebase, all focused on solving real user problems. My ADHD toolkit has active users and I iterate based on feedback."

**For EdTech Roles:**
"I bring a unique perspective - I understand both the data/technical side AND the actual classroom experience. I've built tools that teachers and students actually use, not just theoretical solutions."
