### Content Tips
1. **Tell your story** - Your career transition is unique and valuable

4. **Highlight accessibility** - Especially your ADHD resources - this shows empathy and inclusive design

### Technical Improvements
1. **Add real project images** - Screenshots make your work tangible
2. **Link to live demos** - Whenever possible, let employers interact with your work
3. **Include GitHub links** - Show your code and commit history

5. **Include testimonials** - From students, parents, or colleagues if available

```html
<meta name="description" content="Your compelling description">
<meta name="keywords" content="data analyst, educator, web developer, EdTech">
