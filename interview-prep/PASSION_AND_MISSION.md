# Talking About Your Passion & Mission

## üéØ When & How to Discuss Education + ADHD + Attention Economy

**Key Principle:** Frame passion as ACTION and IMPACT, not just feelings.

---

## ‚úÖ WHEN TO EMPHASIZE YOUR PASSION

### **1. EdTech Companies**
**Companies:** Duolingo, Khan Academy, Quizlet, Newsela, Amplify, ClassDojo

**How to frame it:**
"I'm passionate about education because I've seen firsthand how the right tools can transform learning outcomes. I built my quiz platform because I saw my students struggling with generic tools that didn't meet their needs. Education technology should empower learners, not just digitize textbooks."

**Why this works:** They want people who deeply understand and care about education.

---

### **2. Accessibility-Focused Companies**
**Companies:** Microsoft (accessibility), Apple (accessibility), accessibility startups

**How to frame it:**
"I'm particularly passionate about building for neurodivergent users. My ADHD First Aid Kit came from seeing friends struggle with tools designed for neurotypical brains. We live in a world of constant distraction, and for people with ADHD, that's not just annoying‚Äîit's debilitating. I want to build technology that works WITH how people's brains actually work, not against them."

**Why this works:** Accessibility companies value lived experience and deep understanding of diverse users.

---

### **3. Mental Health Tech**
**Companies:** Headspace, Calm, BetterHelp, Talkspace, ADHD-specific apps (Inflow, etc.)

**How to frame it:**
"I'm drawn to mental health tech because I've built tools specifically for ADHD management. The modern digital world is designed to fragment attention‚Äîconstant notifications, infinite scrolling, dopamine hits. For neurodivergent people, this is especially challenging. I want to build technology that helps people manage their mental health in this environment, not technology that exploits it."

**Why this works:** Shows you understand the problem space deeply and have built solutions.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHEN TO BE CAREFUL

### **Generic Tech Companies / Startups**

**What NOT to say:**
"I'm super passionate about education and ADHD and fighting the attention economy..."

**Why this hurts:**
- They'll think you'll leave for an EdTech company
- Sounds like passion projects > their actual work
- Makes them wonder if you'll care about their product

**What to say instead:**
"I'm passionate about building products that solve real user problems. Whether that's education tools, business software, or consumer apps‚ÄîI care most about understanding users deeply and building solutions that actually work for them."

**Then if they ask more:**
"Yeah, I've mostly built educational tools because that's where I saw the problems firsthand as a teacher, but I'm excited to apply that product thinking to [their domain]."

---

## üéØ HOW TO TALK ABOUT IT (The Right Way)

### **Frame 1: Problem-Solver First, Passionate Second**

**‚ùå Weak:**
"I'm passionate about ADHD and the distraction economy and I really want to help people..."

**‚úÖ Strong:**
"I noticed friends with ADHD struggling with standard productivity apps, so I built an ADHD-specific toolkit. The core insight was: most apps are designed for neurotypical brains. Small changes‚Äîlike larger buttons, reduced visual noise, no auto-playing animations‚Äîmake a huge difference for neurodivergent users. That project taught me a lot about inclusive design, which I now apply to everything I build."

**Why this is better:**
- ‚úÖ Shows you BUILT something (action)
- ‚úÖ Shows technical understanding
- ‚úÖ Shows learning and growth
- ‚úÖ Not preachy

---

### **Frame 2: Connect It to THEIR Mission**

**For EdTech company:**
"What drew me to [Company] is that you're focused on accessibility and engagement. I've spent two years building for learners‚Äîincluding neurodivergent students‚Äîand I've seen how thoughtful design choices can dramatically improve outcomes. I'd love to bring that perspective to [specific product]."

**For generic tech company:**
"What I love about building products is understanding users deeply. In education, I saw how existing tools failed students with ADHD, so I built alternatives. That taught me to question assumptions about 'standard' users and design for edge cases‚Äîwhich often improves the experience for everyone."

**Why this works:**
- ‚úÖ Ties YOUR passion to THEIR needs
- ‚úÖ Shows transferable thinking
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates value you bring

---

## üìù KEY INTERVIEW ANSWERS

### **"What motivates you?" / "Why this work?"**

**Your Answer:**

"Two things: solving real problems and building inclusively.

I'm motivated by seeing a problem I can actually fix. My quiz platform started because 50 students were struggling with Google Forms. I had the skills to build something better, so I did. That immediate feedback loop‚Äîbuild, deploy, see it help people‚Äîthat's what drives me.

I also care deeply about inclusive design. My ADHD toolkit taught me that the modern digital world‚Äîwith constant notifications and infinite scrolling‚Äîis challenging for everyone, but especially for neurodivergent users. I want to build technology that helps people focus and accomplish their goals, not technology that exploits their attention for engagement metrics.

Whether it's education, productivity tools, or [their domain], I'm driven by building things that genuinely improve people's lives, not just their screen time."

**Why this works:**
- ‚úÖ Shows concrete action (not just feelings)
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates user empathy
- ‚úÖ Mentions attention economy thoughtfully (not preachy)
- ‚úÖ Opens door to mission-driven conversation
- ‚úÖ Still applicable to any company

---

### **"Why do you want to work here?"**

**For EdTech:**
"Three reasons:

One: I believe deeply that education technology should empower learners, not just digitize textbooks. I've seen how the right tools can transform outcomes‚Äîmy quiz platform improved student engagement significantly compared to Google Forms.

Two: [Something specific about their product/approach]. I've actually used [their product] with my students / recommended it / studied how it works, and I'm impressed by [specific feature or approach].

Three: [Something about team/tech/growth]. I want to learn from people who've built education products at scale."

**For Accessibility-focused:**
"I'm drawn to companies building for diverse users. My ADHD toolkit taught me that designing for neurodivergent users often makes products better for everyone‚Äîclearer information hierarchy, less visual noise, better focus management. [Company] seems to take that seriously with [specific example], and I'd love to contribute to that mission."

**For Mental Health Tech:**
"Mental health tech is where I want to focus my career. I've built ADHD management tools and seen firsthand how thoughtful design can reduce cognitive load and help people actually use the tools they need. [Company] is doing important work in [specific area], and I want to be part of building technology that helps rather than harms mental health."

**For Generic Tech (careful framing):**
"I'm excited about [their specific product/problem]. I've mostly built educational tools because that's where I saw problems as a teacher, but what I love is the process: deeply understanding users, identifying pain points, and building solutions. That approach translates to any domain. I'm particularly interested in [specific thing about their company]."

---

### **"Tell me about your ADHD First Aid Kit"**

**Your Answer:**

"I built it because friends with ADHD were frustrated with standard productivity apps that made their symptoms worse‚Äîtoo many notifications, too much visual noise, unclear priorities.

I researched how ADHD affects executive function and attention, then designed with those constraints in mind:
- Larger buttons and clear visual hierarchy to reduce decision fatigue
- Optional reduced-motion settings because animations can be distracting
- Timer features because time blindness is a real challenge
- Sensory-friendly color schemes

The technical challenge was balancing simplicity with functionality. I used React for component reusability, deployed on Vercel for fast load times, and user-tested with neurodivergent individuals.

What I learned: designing for edge cases often improves the product for everyone. The clarity and reduced noise that helps ADHD users also helps anyone who's tired, stressed, or context-switching."

**Why this works:**
- ‚úÖ Shows user research
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates technical decisions
- ‚úÖ Shows iteration and testing
- ‚úÖ Broader lesson learned
