## üìÖ WEEK 2 - INTERVIEWS START + KEEP APPLYING

### Goal:
- 5-10 recruiter calls scheduled
- 2-5 first-round interviews
- Continue 15-20 applications/week

### Interview Prep (Do this ONCE, use for ALL interviews):

**Practice These 3 Stories:**

**1. "Tell me about yourself"**
```
"I'm a software developer with 9 deployed applications and a data analytics
background. I have an MS in Economics from Georgia Tech and spent several years
as a data analyst at companies like Homesite Insurance and Grand Circle, where
I built machine learning models and Tableau dashboards.

For the past two years, I've been building web applications independently -
things like educational games for English learners, ADHD accessibility tools,
and school management systems. All are deployed and being used by real people.

I'm looking for a full-time developer role where I can contribute to a team
and continue building products that solve real problems."
```

**2. "Why the gap/career path?"**
```
"After working as a data analyst, I took some time to explore different paths
while completing a full-stack development bootcamp. I worked in operations and
training during that period, which actually taught me a lot about user
experience and working under pressure.

I transitioned back into tech with analyst roles at Homesite and Grand Circle,
and then started building my own applications in 2023. I've really enjoyed the
independent development work, but I'm ready to join a team full-time and
contribute to larger projects."
```

**3. "Tell me about a project you're proud of"**
```
"I'm really proud of the ADHD First Aid Kit I built. I noticed friends
struggling with focus and executive function, so I created a React-based
toolkit with timers, task organizers, and sensory-friendly interfaces.

The interesting challenge was designing for neurodivergent users - I had to
think carefully about cognitive load, color schemes, and information hierarchy.
I did user testing with people who have ADHD and iterated based on their
feedback.

It's deployed on Vercel and people are actually using it, which feels great.
The code is on my GitHub if you want to check it out."
```

**Practice out loud 3x each. Record yourself. It should sound natural, not rehearsed.**

---

## üéØ WEEK 3-4 - CLOSE THE DEAL

### Goal:
- 10+ interviews
- 2-3 final rounds
- 1+ offer

### If You Get an Offer:

**Don't say yes immediately.** Even if you're desperate.

**Say this:**
```
"Thank you so much! I'm really excited about this opportunity. Can I have
48 hours to review the offer and get back to you? I want to make sure I
understand everything and can give you a thoughtful response."
```

**Then:**
1. Check Glassdoor/Levels.fyi for salary data
2. If it's lowball (below $60K), negotiate: "I was hoping for closer to $70K given my experience. Is there any flexibility?"
3. If it's contract, make sure rate is $40+/hr
4. If they won't budge but role is decent: Take it. You can leave in 12 months.

### Red Flags to Avoid:
- ‚ùå "Unpaid trial period"
- ‚ùå Below $50K salary (you can do better)
- ‚ùå "Equity only" for first 6 months
- ‚ùå No clear job description or technical work
- ‚ùå "We'll teach you to code" scams

### Green Flags (Take These):
- ‚úÖ $60K+ salary or $40+/hr contract
- ‚úÖ Real technical work (not just "IT support")
- ‚úÖ Small team, you'll learn a lot
- ‚úÖ EdTech, mission-driven, or growth company
- ‚úÖ Remote or Boston-based
- ‚úÖ Contract-to-hire with clear path to FTE

## üí∞ INCOME BRIDGE STRATEGY

**While job searching:**

**If you need money NOW:**
1. **Upwork/Fiverr** - Offer "build a website" services ($500-2K/project)
2. **Local gigs** - Post on Boston tech Slack/Discord: "Available for contract dev work"
3. **TaskRabbit tech tasks** - "Computer help" pays $50-100/hr
4. **Ask teaching job** - Can they give you more hours temporarily?

**Quick cash sources:**
- Sell unused stuff (Facebook Marketplace)
- Donate plasma ($100-200/week in Boston)
- Food delivery (Uber Eats) on teaching nights after class

**I know it sucks, but 4-6 weeks of hustling beats another year in the restaurant.**

## üìä TRACK YOUR PROGRESS

**Create a spreadsheet (Google Sheets):**

| Date | Company | Role | Source | Status | Next Step |
|------|---------|------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1/15 | Robert Half | Contract Dev | Email | Sent resume | Wait for call |
| 1/15 | Duolingo | Jr Developer | LinkedIn | Applied | Follow up 1/20 |

**Update daily. Aim for:**
- Week 1: 50 applications
- Week 2: 30 applications + 5-10 calls
- Week 3: 20 applications + 5-10 interviews
- Week 4: 10 applications + final rounds + OFFER

---

## üî• EMERGENCY BACKUP PLAN

**If Week 3 hits and you have NO interviews:**

**Immediate actions:**
1. Post on Reddit r/bostonjobs: "Developer seeking work, 9 apps, available immediately"
2. Email every Georgia Tech alumni in Boston tech (use LinkedIn alumni search)
3. Apply to 100% of contract jobs on Indeed (no filter)
4. Reach out to former Harvard colleagues: "Hey, my company laid me off, looking for leads"
5. Consider: Teaching bootcamps (General Assembly, Coding Temple as instructor)

**Nuclear option (if you're truly desperate by Week 4):**
- Take ANY tech-adjacent job to pay bills:
  - Technical support at any company ($45-60K)
  - Junior QA tester ($50-65K)
  - IT helpdesk ($40-55K)
  - Educational content creator (remote)

**Then keep applying for developer jobs while employed.**
