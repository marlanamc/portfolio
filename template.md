## **Pro Tips**

1. **Lead with impact** — Put Results & Impact section early if you have strong metrics
2. **Be specific** — "50+ students" not "many users"; "Reduced grading time by 75%" not "saved time"
3. **Show, don't tell** — Use screenshots to demonstrate features, not just describe them
4. **Keep it scannable** — Use bullets, subheadings, and visual hierarchy
5. **Tell a story** — Problem → Solution → Impact flows better than feature lists
6. **One technical deep-dive** — Pick 1-2 interesting challenges to explain in detail, not everything
