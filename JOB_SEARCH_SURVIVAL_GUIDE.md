## üö® EMERGENCY PROTOCOL: When You Want to Quit

### The 24-Hour Rule
**Don't quit on a bad day.** Wait 24 hours. Sleep on it. Try again tomorrow.

### The "One Thing" Protocol
When you're overwhelmed, do ONE thing:
- ‚úÖ Apply to ONE job
- ‚úÖ Message ONE person
- ‚úÖ Update ONE part of your portfolio
- ‚úÖ Send ONE email

Then STOP. You've done enough.

### The Reset Protocol
When you're spiraling:
1. **Close LinkedIn** (for 24 hours)
2. **Go outside** (walk, coffee, library)
3. **Do something creative** (code something fun, draw, write)
4. **Reconnect with purpose** (look at your portfolio, remember why you're doing this)

### The "Fuck It" Reset
When you're stuck:
- Apply to jobs you think you're "not qualified for"
- Message people you're scared to message
- Post something on LinkedIn
- Apply to weird jobs (maybe they're perfect)

**You literally can't make it worse. Nothing is off the table.**

## üí™ Phase 6: When You're Stuck

### The "Pivot" Protocol
If you've been applying for 2+ months with no results:

1. **Get feedback:**
   - Ask a recruiter to review your resume
   - Post on r/cscareerquestions
   - Ask someone in Boston tech to review

2. **Adjust strategy:**
   - Are you applying to the right roles?
   - Is your portfolio clear?
   - Are you networking enough?

3. **Consider a pivot:**
   - Try contract work to build experience
   - Take a bridge role (teaching, support)
   - Build something bigger/better
   - Get additional training

### The "Burnout" Protocol
If you're burned out:

1. **Take 1-2 weeks OFF job searching**
2. **Focus on income work**
3. **Build something fun**
4. **Reconnect with your why**
5. **Come back refreshed**

**It's okay to pause. You're not quitting - you're recharging.**

## üí¨ Your Story (To Tell Yourself & Others)

### The Honest Version
"I've been exploring different paths - data analytics, teaching ESOL, and now full-stack development. This journey led me to build 10+ real applications serving 350+ users. I bring a unique combination of analytical rigor, hands-on development skills, and deep user empathy - especially for adult learners and accessibility."

### The "Why You're Different" Version
"Most developers can code. I can code AND I understand users because I've been a teacher. I can analyze data AND I can translate it into products. I'm not just building apps - I'm solving real problems I've witnessed firsthand."
